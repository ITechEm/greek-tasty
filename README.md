## My footprint in this project
This is a `full-stack` project created by dejwid and `modified by me`.

## Scope of this project

✨ Understanding front-end and back-end development better. Having a FE and a BE that communicate,
   helps me better to understand how an app works.
```

## Technology Stack and Features

｡🇯‌🇸‌‌ JavaScript for front-end and back-end
💾 MongoDB for database

## Deployment

The easiest way to `deploy` my project was to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
